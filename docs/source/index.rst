**Bioconda** is a channel for the conda_ package manager
specializing in bioinformatics software. Bioconda consists of:

- a `repository of recipes`_ hosted on GitHub
- a `build system`_ turning these recipes into conda packages
- a `repository of packages`_ containing over 7000 bioinformatics
  packages ready to use with ``conda install``
- over 850 contributors and 570 members who add, modify, update and
  maintain the recipes

.. _`repository of packages`: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/

The conda package manager makes installing software a vastly more
streamlined process. Conda is a combination of other package managers
you may have encountered, such as pip, CPAN, CRAN, Bioconductor,
apt-get, and homebrew.  Conda is both language- and OS-agnostic, and
can be used to install C/C++, Fortran, Go, R, Python, Java etc
programs on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

Conda allows separation of packages into repositories, or ``channels``.
The main ``defaults`` channel has a large number of common
packages. Users can add additional channels from which to install
software packages not available in the defaults channel. Bioconda is
one such channel specializing in bioinformatics software.

Each package added to Bioconda also has a corresponding Docker
`BioContainer`_ automatically created and uploaded to `Quay.io`_. A
list of these and other containers can be found at the `Biocontainers
Registry`_.
