# Bioconda Documentation

The [Bioconda Documentation](https://bioconda.github.io) is built with
Sphinx from sources located at
[bioconda/bioconda-utils/docs/source](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils/tree/master/docs/source).

If you have found a mistake in our documentation, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils/issues/new?labels=Docs&title=Docs:%20[describe%20issue]),
or better yet, edit the file on Github and open a PR.

The package index is regenerated daily and may not reflect the most
current uploads to the Bioconda channel.
